A new Flutter application.

Each app always can be improved. It can be improved in hundreds of ways. Let's start on our todo list.

Please, add the ability to remove an item from the list. Do it as you want.

We suggest choosing one of the variants:

Add â€˜minus' button to each item in the list.
Add swipe action for removing an item.
The simplest variant, add one more button to the screen and remove items in some order.
Additionally, you can try to update UI for items. It can be borders, different fonts, etc. Just start exploring widget catalog. You can customize our ListTile for creating more friendly item UI.

Good luck!
